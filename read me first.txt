2. The visualization of the example goal model is presented in file goalmodel.jpg.
3. Load GeneratePATCodeFromGM.R into IDE for R e.g. Rstudio or R console.
4. Run R code.
5. The output file can be found in Path C:\Users\Administrator\Documents.
6. Create a CSP model in PAT and paste the code in the output file to Specification Window.
